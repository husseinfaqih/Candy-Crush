# Candy Crush - MERN Stack - E-Commerce - Class 41 final project

We built an e-commerce website called "***Sugar Rush***" for an online candy store.

 - The website is a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly application.
 - We have a candy database that stores information about various products.
 - Users can browse, sort, and filter the products based on their preferences.
 - They can also rate and comment on the products to share their feedback.
 - Additional features include the ability to add products to favorites and the shopping basket.
 - We implemented payment integration using Stripe.js, allowing users to securely make payments during the checkout process.
